NLP 1 - In the lecture, we explored Natural Language Processing (NLP), delving into its necessity in understanding and processing human language. We examined real-world applications spanning chatbots, sentiment analysis, and language translation. Common NLP tasks, including named entity recognition and text summarization, were discussed, along with various approaches such as rule-based and machine-learning methods. The lecture also highlighted challenges in NLP, such as ambiguity and context sensitivity, emphasizing the ongoing pursuit of effective solutions in this dynamic field.

NLP 2 - In the lecture, we covered the NLP pipeline, a systematic process with five crucial stages. Beginning with data acquisition, we discussed methods for obtaining relevant textual data. Text preparation followed, involving cleaning, tokenization, and normalization. Feature engineering addressed the extraction of meaningful information for model input. Modeling explored techniques for building effective NLP models. Finally, deployment considerations for real-world applications were emphasized, highlighting the end-to-end journey from acquiring data to deploying NLP solutions. This comprehensive pipeline underscores the structured approach to harnessing the power of natural language processing.
