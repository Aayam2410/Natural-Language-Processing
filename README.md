NLP 1 - In the lecture, we explored Natural Language Processing (NLP), delving into its necessity in understanding and processing human language. We examined real-world applications spanning chatbots, sentiment analysis, and language translation. Common NLP tasks, including named entity recognition and text summarization, were discussed, along with various approaches such as rule-based and machine-learning methods. The lecture also highlighted challenges in NLP, such as ambiguity and context sensitivity, emphasizing the ongoing pursuit of effective solutions in this dynamic field.

NLP 2 - In the lecture, we covered the NLP pipeline, a systematic process with five crucial stages. Beginning with data acquisition, we discussed methods for obtaining relevant textual data. Text preparation followed, involving cleaning, tokenization, and normalization. Feature engineering addressed the extraction of meaningful information for model input. Modeling explored techniques for building effective NLP models. Finally, deployment considerations for real-world applications were emphasized, highlighting the end-to-end journey from acquiring data to deploying NLP solutions. This comprehensive pipeline underscores the structured approach to harnessing the power of natural language processing.

NLP 3 - In the lecture on Text Preprocessing, we explored essential techniques for refining raw text data. Covering a spectrum of methods, we delved into lowercasing, removing HTML tags, URLs, and punctuations, addressing chat word treatment, spelling corrections, removing stopwords, handling emojis, tokenization, lemmatization, and stemming. These techniques collectively aim to enhance the quality and consistency of text data, laying the groundwork for effective natural language processing tasks and fostering a deeper understanding of the intricacies involved in preparing textual information for analysis and modeling.
